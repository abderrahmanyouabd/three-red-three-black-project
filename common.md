When a new game is started, the program must ask for the names of the player(s).

* **Puzzle games**: The program must store the results of the games as follows. For each game, the following information must be stored: the date and time when the game was started/finished, the name of the player, the number of moves made by the player during the game, and the outcome (the puzzle is solved/given up). The program must show a high-score table in which the top 10 results are displayed. You can score the players based on the steps/time required to solve the puzzle.

* **Two-player games**: The program must store the results of the games as follows. For each game, the following information must be stored: the date and time when the game started, the name of the players, the number of turns made by the players during the game, and the name of the winner. The program should be able to display a high-score table in which the top 5 players with the most wins are displayed.

The game must store data in a database, in a JSON file, or in an XML document.

Optionally, you can implement load/save game functionality.
