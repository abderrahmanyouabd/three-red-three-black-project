Consider 16 small boxes arranged in a line, 3 red stones, and 3 black stones. Initially, the stones are placed in the boxes as follows (O's represent red stones, X's represent black stones):

```
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| O | X | O | X | O | X |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```

In a move, two adjacent stones must be taken out of the boxes, then they must be put into two adjacent empty boxes preserving their order. The goal of the game is to arrange the stones in the following order:

```
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| O | O | O | X | X | X |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```
